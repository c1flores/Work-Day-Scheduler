# Work-Day-Scheduler
This repository is an exhibition of a simple calendar application. The user can use it to save events for each hour of the day.

## Why is scheduling important?
Scheduling is the art of planning your activities so that you can achieve your goals and priorities in the time you have available. Using a day scheduler for time management provides a plethora of benefits such as: realistic goal-setting, enough allotted time for essential tasks, contingency time for "the unexpected", and overall a good work-life balance. 

## How did I refactor the codebase for this particular assignment?
With  HTML and CSS provided, I simply used Bootstrap to rapidly create a responsive interface with hourly time blocks and the Moment.js JavaScript library to manipulate and display time easily. I also used jQuery for facilitated HTML DOM transversal.
