This repository is an exhibition of a simple calendar application. The user can use it to save events for each hour of the day.

## Why is scheduling important?
Scheduling is the art of planning your activities so that you can achieve your goals and priorities in the time you have available. Using a day scheduler for time management provides a plethora of benefits such as: realistic goal-setting, enough allotted time for essential tasks, contingency time for "the unexpected", and overall a good work-life balance.
